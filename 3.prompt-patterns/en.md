# Prompt Patterns – Reusable Prompt Design Templates

This section introduces reusable prompt design patterns
for recurring problem types.

The goal is not to write a good prompt once,
but to build reusable and maintainable prompt structures.

## What is a prompt pattern?

A prompt pattern is a structured design approach
for solving a specific type of problem with language models.

A pattern defines:

- the order of instructions
- intermediate reasoning steps
- and the organization of the final output.

## Patterns covered in this section

This repository focuses on three fundamental patterns:

- Few-shot prompting
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- Self-critique prompting

These patterns are directly applicable to:

- software engineering tasks
- data and AI workflows
- analysis and reporting pipelines.

## Why does pattern selection matter?

The same task can be solved using different patterns.
However, an inappropriate pattern often leads to:

- unnecessarily verbose outputs
- flawed reasoning
- unstable results.

Choosing the right pattern is therefore
an important part of prompt design.
