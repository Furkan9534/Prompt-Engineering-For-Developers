# Prompt Engineering for Developers – Introduction

This repository is designed to teach
not how to write better questions,
but how to design better systems around large language models.

Prompt engineering is treated here as an engineering discipline,
not as a communication trick.

## Why does this repository exist?

Most prompt engineering resources on the internet focus on:

- ready-made prompt collections
- copy–paste examples
- simple role-based instructions

However, real-world systems face different problems:

- the same prompt does not always produce stable results
- output formats are inconsistent
- hallucinated or unreliable information appears
- generated outputs cannot be easily integrated into software systems

This repository focuses on solving these problems.

## What is prompt engineering?

Prompt engineering is the structured design of model inputs
to control:

- model behavior
- reasoning strategy
- and output structure

in a reproducible and measurable way.

It can be considered as:

- input engineering
- interface design
- and control of reasoning processes.

## Who is this repository for?

This training is designed mainly for:

- software engineers
- data scientists and AI practitioners
- product and business analysts
- developers building LLM-based systems

---

## What this repository does NOT teach

This repository is not about:

- “best ChatGPT prompts”
- “100 ready-made prompts”
- quick copy–paste solutions

The goal is not to obtain a good answer once,
but to design prompts that can be maintained and improved.

---

## How is this repository structured?

The repository is organized around:

- core prompt structure
- reusable prompt design patterns
- evaluation and iterative improvement
- real-world use cases
- API-based and system-level integration

Each section includes:

- problem definition
- design principles
- practical examples
- reusable structures

---

## Core philosophy

Throughout this repository, a prompt is treated as
a system component.

A prompt should be:

- versioned
- tested
- evaluated
- and iteratively improved.

## How should you use this repository?

While reading this repository:

- relate the examples to your own projects
- focus on the structure and design decisions
  instead of copying the exact text
- create your own variations and experiments

This repository is not a static documentation.
It is an experimentation playground.
